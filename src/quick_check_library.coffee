# Welcome to quick_check.js. This program is written in CoffeeScript, but the
# source is quite simple and shouldn't be too dificult to understand.
#
# We start by defining our main function, `qc` which performs the actual checking
# and also we use it to namespace all our other public functions. Functions without
# the qc prefix are considered private to this library.
#
# The qc function will generate 100 test cases and run the supplied property.
# Based on the resulting value, we either succeed, fail or skip the test. Additionally
# if a string is returned we classify the tests based on the returned string.
#
# For failed cases we want to then make the example minimal in a process called
# shrinking (more on this later on).

# `qc.forAll` is a convenience method for executing quick checks, but the return values are
